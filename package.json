  "description": "This library takes separate declaration asset files generated by the webpack build process and bundles them into one single declaration file. However it does so by recomposing the separate declarations as if all the classes and interfaces were defined as an __internal module__. Therefor, using this plugin only makes sense if you expose the classes and interfaces to the global module space yourself.",
